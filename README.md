This repository contains an academic research project conducted as part of my Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) degree at Christ (Deemed to be University). The focus of the research was to explore the role and impact of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in the Indian economy.

Project Overview

The research aimed to analyze the influence of NBFCs on the Indian financial system by examining the following key aspects:

Sectoral Distribution of NBFC Credit: A detailed analysis of how NBFCs allocate credit across different sectors of the economy.
Comparison with Traditional Banking: A comparative study of the credit distribution and operational dynamics between NBFCs and traditional banking institutions.
Impact on GDP Growth: An evaluation of how NBFC credit contributes to the overall GDP growth of the Indian economy.
Key Findings

NBFCs play a complementary role to traditional banks in the financial ecosystem.
While NBFCs contribute significantly to certain sectors, their overall credit impact remains smaller compared to that of traditional banks.
The study highlights the importance of NBFCs in providing credit to underserved sectors of the economy, filling gaps left by traditional banking channels.
Conclusion

This research concludes that NBFCs, despite their comparatively smaller credit impact, are an integral part of the Indian financial landscape. Their ability to cater to niche sectors and complement the functions of traditional banks plays a vital role in supporting economic growth.
